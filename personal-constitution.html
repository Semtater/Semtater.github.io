    <h1>My Personal Constitution</h1>
    <h2>What I value most...</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <h3>My personal relationship with God</h3>
        <p>I srtive to emulate the example set by Christ. Every day prayer and scripture study are top on my list. Then comes sacrament meeting attendance and sabbath day observance each week. Monthly temple attendance is habit that I have formed.
        My spirit is my source of power and motivation to accomplish things. It stems off depression and keeps me at my best. I want to strive for a powerful spiritual experience, one that requires much labor in the spirit, but it is not to be my conversion story. My conversion story is of the little things that happen every day in my life that show the hand of God.
        The Prophet Joseph Smith said, "It is the first principle of the gospel to know for a certainty the character of God." Furthermore, he added, "I want you all to know Him, and to be familiar with Him." We must have "a correct idea of his... perfections, and attributes" and an admiration for "the excellency of [His] character."  -Elder Jeffrey R. Holland
        I study the words of the prophets, both ancient and modern.</p>
        <p>Accumulating as much light as we can is the key to successfully passing the test of mortal life.
        -Elder Larry R. Lawrence

        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Eternal Marriage</h3>
        <p>Marriage and family is the single most important thing that I can do in this life.
        I am worthy and I work hard for the woman that is my wife.
        I emulate the attributes that I desire in an eternal companion.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>I accomplish this by prioritizing my activities and eliminating the ones that push me farther away from my goals.
        I like to plan every day, every week, every month, every quarter, every year, and every five years with a vision to what the end of my life and eternity are going to end up like. Now is the time to take control of my life and get it to where I want it to be. I need the tools in order to get my life in order. This personal constitution is one of the tools necessary to do such.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>I graduated college so that I could go on to a good career and get paid to do wonderful things. I persevered until I finally managed to succeed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>I am an amazing employee that earns money and makes a living. I seek to build the company that I am in and it seeks to build me.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Financial stability</h3>
        <p>I am independent in my finances. I have enough to provide for my needs and those of my family and other people.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>I keep in touch with my brothers and sisters. I call my mom regularly. I call my dad and talk to all of my brothers and sisters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>My health</h3>
        <p>I take care of my physical body as well as my mental, emotional and spiritual needs. 
        I fit into normal-sized clothing because I am muscular and not anorexically skinny. I embrace who I am as a person, but I seek to build myself up physically as well so that I can have more energy and serve more people.
        It is important to get enough sleep, eat right, and take breaks as necessary. The key to be constantly aware of myself. When I try and do too much, it just burns me out. But, I am loving being productive and putting myself at the top of the game. I stick to my values no matter what.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Church</h3>
        <p>I serve in the church. There are people there that need me. I am a leader, and a friend to all. People can count on me in my callings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Cleanliness</h3>
        <p>I make sure to stay organized in my personal and common living spaces. I clean up wherever I leave a mess. I clean things in the moment instead of putting it off.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Community involvement/Humanitarian services</h3>
        <p>I help Neil with Love At Work, and I build him up. I find ways to serve locally as well. I connect and network where I can.
        I get involved politically and I stay up to date on the latest issues. I make informed votes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <h3>Personal cultivation - Skill Development</h3>
        <p>I do things that are recreational and also that build me up and inspire me. I am educated in higher ways and I seek better ways to do things constantly.</p>
