        <h2>3/2/16</h2>
        <p>I need to get a hold of myself. I need to not fail out of college. Emily is here. Emily is a good friend, and we do a lot of things together. We get along.</p>
        <h2>3/4/16</h2>
        <p>I am just outside the gate. I need to choose to enter in. He is waiting for me. I just need to accept him fully in my life and let him in. Solid, concrete steps toward salvation and eternal marriage and happiness.</p>
        <h2>3/10/16</h2>
        <p>I had a crazy cool dream last night. So, I had a dream that I was a part of a really large organization on campus. It was the most popular group ever, but everyone in it was obsessed with gaining the attention of others.</p>
        <p>We were coming up on electing the president of the club, and everyone was going to show their vote by sticking a piece of chewing gum to their face. Voting for one was manifested by horizontally across your face, and voting for the other was manifested by stretching the gum from your mouth across the top of your head.</p>
        <p>The thing is, the current club president had already rigged it and told everyone to vote for her. So, she literally had well over one thousand votes.</p>
        <p>So, everybody is running around trying to fit in with the cool kids. I'm noticing which  groups and cliques within the club are the best, and which people are the "uncool" loners.</p>
        <p>At the very end, I found these two guys. One of them was Bronson and Krissia Beatty's little brother. I always thought of him as a strange kid, but I saw him here. There was a moment of silence while everyone listened to an announcement. The announcement ended and while everyone was still silent with anticipation in case there was more, this kid and another guy started dancing a weird form of swing dance combined with break dancing. It was really trippy, but they pulled it off and it was completely silent while they danced for about ten seconds and everyone watched. When they finished, everyone started clapping.</p>
        <p>I need to remember the form of their dancing in order to replicate it. They spun each other to the side, did some cool spins while the other jumped over his legs, and then finished off with one doing the splits while lifting the other into a breakdance freeze over his head.</p>
